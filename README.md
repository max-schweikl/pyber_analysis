# Ride Sharing (Pyber Analysis)

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to show a summarized view of ride-sharing data by city type.  We specifically looked at rural, suburban and urban city types, and looked at total fare trend by time of year as well as average fares per ride and driver.  The goal is by after better understanding this analysis that Pyber can help improve ride-sharing access and appropriately price based on the market that they're serving.

## Results

Based on the below chart, the following findings can be applied:
  - Rural markets have both the highest average fare per ride and the highest average fare per driver.
  - Urban markets have both the highest total rides AND the highest total drivers.  This is likely due to having a disproportionately higher population density in this market compared to the suburban and rural markets.
  - Total fares in the urban market came in at the highest, which is likely due to having the highest total rides and total drivers.  That being said, their average fare per ride and average fare per driver were the lowest of the three markets, which may indicate that fare revenue is higher in city types that have a higher driver to rider ratio.

## Summary

Based on the findings in this analysis, the recommendations to Pyber are the following:
  - More drivers should be hired or shifted to rural markets, to ensure demand is met and more cost affordability per trip.  Currently theres' too much demand for rides in rural markets which may be driving up the cost of rides.  It looks like longer trips are also being taken, so a more likely chance that any rural market drivers are currently on a trip.
  - Decrease driver count in urban markets.  Currently drivers out-pace riders by 780 trips, which may be saturating the market with too many available drivers, thus why fares are so cheap.  Drivers are also likely making shorter trips and thus more available as indicated by the low average fare per driver.  Pyber should look at moving some urban drivers to rural markets if they're willing to make the drive to that area.
  - Suburban markets also don't have the driver count to satisfy the rider demand, however average fares per ride and driver are mostly neutral.  That being said, it may behoove Pyber to still transfer some drivers in to the suburban market or look to hire more drivers specifically for suburbs.
